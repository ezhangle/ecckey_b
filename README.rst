Abstract
--------

ECCKey is a command line utility for generating ECC-based product keys (ECC stands for **elliptic curve cryptography**). Here in Tibbo we use ECCKey to generate product keys for `IO Ninja <http://tibbo.com/ninja>`_. You can use ECCKey as a ready-to-use generator of product keys for shareware products of all kinds.
